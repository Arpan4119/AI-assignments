        "\n",
        "This Python script is designed to solve a sliding puzzle, commonly known as the 8-puzzle or 15-puzzle, using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. The goal is to find a sequence of moves that transforms the initial puzzle configuration to the goal configuration.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Puzzle Representation\n",
        "\n",
        "The puzzle is represented as a grid of numbers, typically in a square layout. Each number occupies a position in the grid, and the player's objective is to rearrange the numbers by sliding them horizontally or vertically, one at a time, into the empty cell.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Functions and Logic\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **`is_valid(x, y, size)`**: This function checks whether a move represented by the coordinates `(x, y)` is valid within the puzzle's dimensions (`size`). It ensures the move does not go beyond the boundaries of the puzzle.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`move_to(state, move, size)`**: This function applies a move to the puzzle state. It takes the current state of the puzzle (`state`), the move to be applied (`move`), and the puzzle size (`size`). It swaps the position of the empty cell (represented by `0`) with the adjacent cell according to the provided move.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **`read_csv(file_name)`**: This function reads puzzle states from a CSV file. The CSV file should contain a comma-separated list of numbers representing the puzzle's initial or goal state.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **`dfs(current_state, goal_state, direction, vis, path, path_direction, size)`**: This is the core DFS function. It recursively explores possible moves from the current puzzle state to the goal state. It maintains a set of visited states (`vis`) to avoid revisiting states, a list of visited states (`path`), and a list of move directions (`path_direction`) that lead to each visited state.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **`solve(start_file, goal_file, solution_file)`**: This is the main function that orchestrates the puzzle solving process. It takes the names of the initial and goal state CSV files and an output file name for the solution. It reads the initial and goal states from the CSV files, validates their sizes, and initiates the DFS algorithm. The solution steps and move directions are written to the output file.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Usage\n",
        "\n",
        "The script begins by defining the filenames for the initial state (`start_file`), goal state (`goal_file`), and the solution output file (`solution_file`). The `solve` function is called with these filenames to start the puzzle-solving process.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Input and Output\n",
        "\n",
        "- The user is prompted to enter the size of the puzzle (3 for 8-puzzle, 4 for 15-puzzle).\n",
        "- The script reads the initial and goal states from CSV files.\n",
        "- The DFS algorithm searches for a solution path, recording each step and move direction.\n",
